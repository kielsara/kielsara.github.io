# **About Me**

Hi! I am **{{ Sara Kiel }}**,<br>
and I am currently a graduate student at The University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign studying Information Management within the School of Information Sciences.

My undergraduate degree is in Anthropology with a Sociocultural and Linguistic focus, and I received an interdisciplinary certificate in Social Design due to a passion for human-centered design. I also have a small background in STEM, having studied chemistry and engineering for 1.5 years of undergrad. 

In the future, I hope to enter the User Experience field in order to combine my interests in the social sciences, technology, and design! You can see how I am preparing myself for this future right here on my Portfolio. Thanks for visiting!
